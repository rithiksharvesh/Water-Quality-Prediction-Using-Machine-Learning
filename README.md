  - Encoding categorical variables

### 4. **Working Methodology**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Correlation matrix and statistical summaries
   - Visualizations to uncover hidden patterns and distributions

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**
   - Imbalanced data handling
   - Normalization & encoding

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creation of new features like **ratios** and **WQI indicators**

4. **Train-Test Split:**
   - 70-80% for training
   - 20-30% for testing

5. **Model Building:**

   - Random Forest outperformed others in prediction quality.

### 5. **Best Model**
- **Random Forest** emerged as the most accurate and robust model for:
  - ðŸ”¹ WQI Prediction
  - ðŸ”¹ Water Usability Classification

### 6. **Sample Outputs**
- Graphs and charts displaying:
  - Predicted WQI levels
  - Usability class (e.g., Fit, Not Fit, Partially Fit)
- Visual summary of model performance

### 7. **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

### 8. **Future Work**
- Incorporate **real-time water data streams** via IoT.

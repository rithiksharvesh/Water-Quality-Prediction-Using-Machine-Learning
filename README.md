# Water-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to pioneer a best machine learning model to predict WQI index and Water useability . By leveraging the power of data-driven models, we aim to develop a robust and dependable prediction system capable of estimating vital water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity, and chemical concentrations.
